5,A,3,34.4,"",You are involved in heat treating of parts and want to perform a Gauge r&R analysis on the hardness tester.
6,A,3,34.5,"","To measure hardness, a piece of the product is cut, prepared and tested."
7,A,4,33.9,"","That piece is altered, so it cannot be retested.Â  The parts are produced in small batches."
8,A,4,34.5,"",You are confident that the parts within a batch are homogeneous.

10,A,5,34.7,"",You would like each operator to test two parts per batch.
11,B,6,32.5,"",But there are not always enough parts for each operator to test parts from each batch.
12,B,6,32.1,"",You will have to use a nested design.Â  You decide to use 15 batches and take 2 parts from each batch.
